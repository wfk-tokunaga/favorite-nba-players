  "description": "Broadly, this is a tool that allows users to pick certain items from a predefined set over others, repeatedly, until a single favorite is found, and then continue to pick for second place and so on, constructing a list. It is a generalization of the [Favorite Pok√©mon Picker](https://www.dragonflycave.com/favorite.html). If you haven't seen that tool before, look there and play around with it to get a better idea of what this is about.",
